# My Portfolio ðŸŒŸ
This repository contains my portfolio website, accessible at [https://willyfh.github.io/](https://willyfh.github.io/). It's customized based on the [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) theme.

For detailed installation instructions, please refer to the al-folio repository.

Within this project, I've introduced several enhancements, including:
- Addition of a peer-review page
- Addition of a direct link to the CV in the navigation bar
- And a few additional customizations that don't need elaboration ðŸ˜„

Feel free to use this version!
